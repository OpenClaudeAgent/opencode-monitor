### US-12: Complete Data Validation

**Story ID**: DQ-012  
**Points**: 3  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Assignee**: TBD (QA Lead)

**As a** QA lead,  
**I want** all data completeness checks automated with daily health reports,  
**So that** we can guarantee 100% data integrity on production and detect issues proactively.

**Current State**: Manual validation, no health checks → Cannot guarantee data quality

**Target State**: Automated validation suite with daily reports and alerts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Validation queries for each data type (15+ checks)
- [ ] Automated daily health checks (scheduled job)
- [ ] Reports on data gaps/anomalies (sent to team)
- [ ] Alerting on threshold violations (Slack/email)
- [ ] Documentation of validation rules (wiki page)
- [ ] Historical tracking of improvements (dashboard)

**Validation Checks**:

    'Plan 45 Tables' as check_name,
    COUNT(*) as exchanges_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exchange_traces) as traces_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'FAIL: exchanges table empty'

### US-13: Performance Optimization & Go-Live

**Story ID**: DQ-013  
**Points**: 2  
**Priority**: P3 - Low  
**Assignee**: TBD (DevOps)

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** all performance optimizations deployed to production with monitoring,  
**So that** users experience fast, reliable analytics and we can detect issues proactively.

**Current State**: Changes in staging, no monitoring → Not production-ready

**Target State**: Production deployment with full monitoring and rollback capability

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Query benchmarks show <250ms latency (50% improvement)
- [ ] All P0 indexes deployed to production
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show improvement metrics
- [ ] Zero regressions from baseline (validated)
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Team signed off on go-live readiness

**Performance Benchmarks**:
```sql
-- Benchmark 1: Agents by name (should be <10ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM agents WHERE name = 'test';

-- Benchmark 2: Tools by session (should be <50ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT tc.tool_name, COUNT(*) as calls
FROM tool_calls tc
JOIN parts p ON tc.part_id = p.part_id
WHERE p.session_id = 'test-session'
GROUP BY tc.tool_name;

-- Benchmark 3: Error breakdown (should be <100ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT error_category, COUNT(*) as count
FROM errors
GROUP BY error_category;

-- Benchmark 4: Cost trends (should be <200ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, SUM(total_cost_usd) as cost
FROM session_resource_metrics
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;

-- Benchmark 5: Session details (should be <150ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT s.session_id, m.model_name, COUNT(p.part_id) as parts,
       srm.total_cost_usd, srm.total_input_tokens + srm.total_output_tokens as tokens
FROM sessions s
JOIN models m ON s.model_id = m.model_id
LEFT JOIN parts p ON s.session_id = p.session_id
LEFT JOIN session_resource_metrics srm ON s.session_id = srm.session_id
GROUP BY s.session_id, m.model_name, srm.total_cost_usd, srm.total_input_tokens, srm.total_output_tokens
LIMIT 100;
```

**Monitoring Dashboards**:

**1. Performance Monitoring**:
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Database size growth
- Index hit rate
- Cache hit rate

**2. Data Quality Monitoring**:
- Data completeness (% fields populated)
- Error classification rate
- Data freshness (last update time)
- Health check pass rate

**3. Business Metrics Monitoring**:
- Daily cost trends
- Token usage trends
- Error rate trends
- Session count trends

**4. System Health**:
- Indexer running status
- Bulk loader status
- Race condition incidents
- Data loss incidents (should be 0)
